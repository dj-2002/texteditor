About this app
Text editor is a fast, stable and fully featured plain text editor for android. It is lightweight and comes with advance tools that can be used to edit any kind of plain text file(TXT, HTML, JSON and more).

Quick Edit Plain Text Files

Text editor lets you import your existing text file. Simply browse your phone storage and select your text file and the app will load it in a fraction of second. It will let you apply style and formatting to your file without affecting the original file.

Powerful Editor and Text Processor

Tons of formatting and styling tools, PDF export feature, OCR text recognition, direct print, auto-save, text to speech engine, undo and redo feature, one click file sharing. You name it, our app has it. Text Editor offers a sublime and minimal user interface with great user experience.

Secure and Offline Text Editing

Privacy is at the core of our text editor. Our app works offline and does not require any data sharing to format and make edits to your text file. Security and user data safety is our primary concern. All text files and data stay locally on your device.

Smart Text Editor which tells you count of words

You can know the number of words, characters and sentences with just a single click. A lot of times users are required to create document with a word limit. Students are required to maintain word limit while creating their project. Text editor offers a smart solution by automatically counting the above parameters for you.

Convert your plain text files to formatted and styled PDFs

You can stylize your plain text file using bold, italics, underline, strike-through, indentations, alignment, superscript, subscript, bullets, numbering, checklists and more. Plain text files can be exported as PDFs or can be printed to retain the formatting done in the editor.

Our text processor includes a number of performance optimizations and user experience tweaks. It works just like notepad software available on windows platform. The speed and responsiveness of the app is much better than other text editor apps commonly found on Google Play.
